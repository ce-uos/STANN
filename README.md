# STANN

STANN (Synthesis Templates for Artificial Neural Networks) is a template library used to build FPGA-based neural network accelerators via High-Level Synthesis. 

This project cannot be synthesized on its own but can be used by other projects to implement neural networks on FPGAs.

# Example project

The following project demonstrates how to use STANN to implement LeNet-5 and TenNet (simple neural network with 10 layers): https://github.com/ce-uos/stann-example
